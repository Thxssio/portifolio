# AgroPulse Hub: From Discovery to Launch Day

![AgroPulse modules organized on a dashboard](../Assets/Projects/agropulsehub.png)

Farmers told us they needed less noise and more actionable insight. AgroPulse became our experiment in translating field interviews into an end-to-end SaaS platform.

## Discovery Sprint

- **Field interviews** across dairy, crops, and logistics surfaced nine recurring pain points.
- **Opportunity mapping** grouped problems into Precision Agriculture, Livestock, Digital Commerce, Bioinputs, and FoodTech modules.
- **Scoping workshops** with UFSM/InovaTec helped us rank features by ROI + implementation effort.

## Build Timeline

1. **Rapid prototypes** in Figma locked down interactions in under two weeks.
2. **Laravel backend** with a modular architecture allowed us to toggle entire feature clusters.
3. **Progressive rollout**: each module launched to a pilot group with a data validation playbook.

## Impact Snapshot

- Cut weekly reporting time by 43% for early adopters.
- Created a data bridge between remote agronomists and on-site operators.
- Laid groundwork for partner analytics with PostgreSQL views tailored per co-op.

## What I'd Repeat

> Lean documentation beats heavy specs. Our single source-of-truth Notion doc kept alignment without slowing velocity.
